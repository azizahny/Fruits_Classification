# Fruits_Classification

This work is just my practice to learn data science.

I changed some codes a lil bit because I don't know why I keep encountering the 'pandas.tools'.
So, I just deleted the '.tools' as the answers in stackoverflow, but I still stuck. 
Therefore, I watch a video on youtube and eventually use the seaborn sns, but don't forget to determine the variable into the fruits_feature. So, that's it. FINALLY I GOT THE SCATTERED MATRIX !

This one is the one who created the fruits dataset :
